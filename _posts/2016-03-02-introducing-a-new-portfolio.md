<span class="caps" alt="W">elcome</span>, sweet season of delight, /
What beauties charm the wond'ring sight /
In thy enchanting reign! /
How fresh descends the morning dew, /
Whilst op'ning flow'rs of various hue /
Bedeck the sprightly plain. /
The artless warblers of the grove /
Again unite in songs of love, /
To bless thy kind return: /
But first the lark, who roaring seems /
To hail the orb of day, whose beams /
With fresh refulgence burn.

The limpid brook that purls along, /
The tuneful blackbird's joyous song, /
The softly-whisp'ring breeze; /
The mossy hills, which now invite, /
These with the verdant meads unite, /
Th' elated mind to please. /
The mind with thoughts of good possest, /
With innocence and virtue blest, /
Untaught in vice's ways; /
May taste those joys by nature giv'n, /
May lift th' enraptur'd eye to heav'n, /
And their great Author praise. /
Stern Winter's gloomy season past, /
We see fair Spring advances fast, /
With Summer in the rear; /
Soon Autumn's shades will interpose, /
And a succeeding Winter close /
The swift-revolving year.

> Spring is the time of plans and projects.

Of human life an emblem true, /
The early morn of youth we view, /
In Spring's delightful face; /
Meridian life's a Summer's day, /
With Autumn fades; its quick decay, /
In winter's blast we trace. /
Then let us prize each fleeting hour, /
Improve the moments in our pow'r, /
E'er time shall cease to be; /
Then shall our spirits, taking wing, /
Be crown'd with an eternal Spring, /
From Wint'ry storms set free.
