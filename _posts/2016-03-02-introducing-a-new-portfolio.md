title: New Portfolio, New Projects
---

Introducing my new portfolio. Except this is not my new portfolio. This is a [placeholder theme](http://skye.connorbaer.io) until I have finished designing and coding the *real* new portfolio. 

The new portfolio will present my past and current projects. I will describe my approach to each project and what I have learnt in the process. You will get sneak-peaks at my latest projects and I might ask you for feedback. I'm also considering a food section.

It's going to be gorgeous, exciting, and maybe delicous. Check out my [Instagram](https://instagram.com/connor_baer) while I get the portfolio ready for you!
