<span class="caps" alt="C">herry</span> blossoms like gentle   
rain falling on top of a white umbrella   
carried by a little girl   
running towards her mother   
who lifts her up   
kisses her on her peach   
cheek and then they move   
away towards an old temple   

as i watch them   
despite the cold air   
my heart   
begins to light   
a fire   

memories start to burn   
like black and white pictures   
on the trash
