# üå± Spring

A one-page, two-column [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that pairs beautifully styled content with contextual media.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This theme should work as-is, but is no longer actively maintained. [Contributions](#contributing) are welcome!

## Usage

You'll need to have [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), the `bundler` gem, and [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) (`npm` also works) installed on our computer. Spring provides a fully furnished Jekyll setup ‚Äî just clone and install the dependencies:

```bash
# Ruby gems
bundle install
# Node modules
yarn
```

Then simply run `yarn start` to start the Jekyll server on port `4000`.

## Options

Spring includes some customizable options, applied via options in the `_config.yml` file. A standout feature is the dark theme.
Have a look at the [`_config.yml`](_config.yml) file for all available options.

## Contributing

**This theme is no longer actively maintained.** However, I welcome bug fixes and feature request through [pull requests](https://github.com/connor-baer/spring/compare). If you don't feel comfortable making code changes, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/connor-baer/spring/issues/new), perhaps somebody else will help out.
